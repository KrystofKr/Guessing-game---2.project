# Guessing-game---2.project
Simple practise game where you need to guess right number. Commentary included.

I am aware of one error - When you are asked to select difficulty of the game and you insert anything different than one of the options, game will crash. Unfortunately I cant find error in my coding logic, so I will come back later when I wil knew more. Any advice will be appreciated.
